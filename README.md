 Intelligent Activity Recognition

 Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of leveraging deep learning techniques to analyze and recognize human activities from sensor data. It encompasses a full data analysis pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced analytics. The core of the notebook showcases the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, implemented using PyTorch, for the nuanced task of activity recognition.

Additionally, the project delves into the integration of big data technologies, specifically Hadoop and Apache Spark, to manage and process large-scale datasets effectively. This repository serves as a primer for researchers and practitioners aiming to harness the power of deep learning and big data for intelligent activity analysis.
